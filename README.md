# wd.rb
Writings and discouses (wd.rb) is my simple static site generator written in ruby for a blogging website.

# What is it?
This is a ruby file which generates html files for use on [blog.thomveldhuis.xyz](http://blog.thomveldhuis.xyz). This takes text files because thats all that I need and generates a html file using ERB and Ruby.

# Why?
I wanted to have a simple to use something to set up a simple site for writing purposes only. I have tried using jekyll, hugo and some other more obscure solutions but none really spoke to me, so I decided to make my own. This is still in the beginning phases of development but I will try to make it more usable and accessible for others.
